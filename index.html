  </p>
  <p><strong>Happy belated Thanksgiving!!!</strong></p>

<p>Last week was a bit slow on the Inline front. Not much code got done but one important idea came along that (potentially) simplifies the whole Inline::Module dance. We call it <em>auto-stubbing</em>.</p>

<h2>Auto-Stubbing</h2>

<p>When a module has Inline C (or C++) code in it, it needs a <strong>stub</strong> module to invoke Inline and/or dynaload a shared library. This stub is <em>generated code</em>. We had a command for the module auhor to generate it:</p>

<pre><code>perl-inline-module generate Acme::Math::XS::Inline
</code></pre>

<p>and we assumed authors would commit this code, and regenerate it from time to time as Inline::Module required it to change.</p>

<p>(<strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>This is all about author side experience. The user side installation process and result remains the same.</em>)</p>

<p>Last week we called <strong>BS</strong> on that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Generated code should be automagic</li>
<li>Generated code should not get committed if possible</li>
</ul>

<p>We think we figured out how to make this work in a few styles that will fit in with various module author development styles. One of our goals is that when you use Inline::Module, you can test using the pure Perl mantra:</p>

<pre><code>prove -lv t/
</code></pre>

<p>But at this point it is too late to autostub. We need something to happen just before that. One idea is to do this:</p>

<pre><code>PERL5OPT=&#39;-MInline::Module=autostub&#39; prove -lv t/
</code></pre>

<p>or:</p>

<pre><code>export PERL5OPT=&#39;-MInline::Module=autostub&#39;
... later on ...
prove -lv t/
</code></pre>

<p>This adds a CODE ref to <code>@INC</code> to do the autostubbing, just in time.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll have a few ways to do it, so that if you are someone who likes to do everything explicitly, you can still just:</p>

<pre><code>perl-inline-module generate Acme::Math::XS::Inline
</code></pre>

<p>This autostubbing should be done in the next couple days. We&#39;ll let you know how it turned out in the next review.</p>

    November 22, 2014    by
    <a href="page/ingy-and-david-bio.html">Ingy and David</a>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Refinement</strong> and <strong>Releases</strong>. Those are the two words I (David) would use to describe what went on this week in the Inline Grant Project.</p>

<h2>Thanks!</h2>

<p>First, we would like to thank those members of the Perl Community who contributed their suggestions, work, and code to the Inline Grant Project. <strong>leont++</strong> presented a strong case (in the form of a cohesive code example) of how to clean up our <code>Makefile.PL</code> by moving work out of a <code>FixupMakefile</code> function, and into a <code>postamble</code> action. Whereas previously the <code>Makefile.PL</code> might have looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>WriteMakefile(
  …
);

FixupMakefile(
  …
);
</code></pre>

<p>Now they look like this:</p>

<pre><code>WriteMakefile(
  …
  postamble =&gt; &#123;
    inline =&gt; &#123; … &#125;,
  &#125;,
);
</code></pre>

<p>which is a lot cleaner because it works within &quot;the Perl toolchain system&quot; instead of layering an additional step into it. This is documented in <a href="Inline::Module::Tutorial">Inline::Module::Tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>We also are receiving help from <strong>ether++</strong> on updating our <a href="Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineModule">Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineModule</a> plugin to work within this cleaner framework.</p>

<p>Additionally, we released <a href="Module::Install::InlineModule">Module::Install::InlineModule</a>; a plugin to bring <a href="Inline">Inline</a> support to <a href="Module::Install">Module::Install</a> based distributions. So for those keeping score, we now support <a href="ExtUtils::MakeMaker">ExtUtils::MakeMaker</a>, <a href="Dist::Zilla">Dist::Zilla</a>, <a href="Zilla::Dist">Zilla::Dist</a>, and <a href="Module::Install">Module::Install</a> based distributions for <a href="Inline">Inline</a>.</p>

<h2>Modules, Modules, Modules</h2>

<p>We have also released the amazing <a href="Alt::Acme::Math::XS::EUMM">Alt::Acme::Math::XS::EUMM</a> in a new <a href="Module::Install">Module::Install</a> based version. Once again for the benefit of those keeping score, the Inline Grant Project has, to date, spawned eight new modules; some plugins, some proofs of concept, and of course <a href="Inline::Module">Inline::Module</a> itself. Additionally, it has directly contributed to new releases of <a href="Inline">Inline</a>, <a href="Inline::CPP">Inline::CPP</a>, <a href="Inline::C">Inline::C</a>, and many other support modules.</p>

<p>This next week we intend to finish revamping the <a href="Dist::Zilla">Dist::Zilla</a> plugin, tackle <a href="Module::Build">Module::Build</a> support, add more tests, and finally convert a couple of pre-existing CPAN modules to Inline-based modules.</p>

<p>It&#39;s gratifying to see the level of enthusiastic support this project has attracted from the Perl Community. We&#39;re seeing more familiar faces in <code>irc.perl.org#inline</code>, receiving more suggestions, and benefiting more from code contributions than ever before.</p>

<p>As we move across the inchstones leading to the wrapping up of the Inline grant project, we are encouraged by the support that we&#39;ve seen, which demonstrates to us that the end of the grant will only be the beginning of the growth and revitalization of the Inline project.</p>

  <h2 class="blog-post-title">Inline Grant Weekly Report #4</h2>
  <p class="blog-post-meta">
    November 15, 2014    by
    <a href="page/ingy-and-david-bio.html">Ingy and David</a>
  </p>
  <p>The major events of this week were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wrote <a href="Inline::Module::Tutorial">Inline::Module::Tutorial</a></li>
<li>Added Dist::Zilla support for <a href="Inline::Module">Inline::Module</a></li>
<li>Added Zilla::Dist support for <a href="Inline::Module">Inline::Module</a></li>
<li>Released 2 new example modules based on the above:
<ul>
<li><a href="Alt::Acme::Math::XS::DistZilla">Alt::Acme::Math::XS::DistZilla</a></li>
<li><a href="Alt::Acme::Math::XS::ZillaDist">Alt::Acme::Math::XS::ZillaDist</a></li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

<h2>Inline::Module::Tutorial</h2>

<p>This is a work in progress. It explains how to make an XS module using Inline in very basic, specific terms. It only details what we have implemented so far, although there are stub sections for upcoming things. Please give it a read and let us know what you think (in the form of Issues and/or Pull Requests on <a href="https://github.com/ingydotnet/inline-module-pm">https://github.com/ingydotnet/inline-module-pm</a>).</p>

<h2>Dist::Zilla Support</h2>

<p>This is a fun story.</p>

<p>I(ingy) thought I knew how the Dist::Zilla stuff was going to work… I&#39;d simply add these lines to a <code>dist.ini</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[InlineModule]
module = Acme::Math::XS
inline = Acme::Math::XS::Inline
ilsm = Inline::C
</code></pre>

<p>then write a <a href="Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineModule">Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineModule</a> and make it all work. In the end that&#39;s exactly what happened, although the path was bumpier than expected.</p>

<p>I started by strolling over to #distzilla on IRC and asking ether++ a few dzil related questions. Then leont++ jumped in and wanted to know what was going on. I told him a bit and he thought I was getting some things wrong… So I invited him to start coding with me (PairUp style)!</p>

<p>It took us a few minutes to get on the same page, but eventually we did. We got some basics into the plugin but then had to break for other stuff. When I came back, I got ether to PairUp for a while. Pretty soon we had a new module, just barely working well enough to release and then release the Acme module based off of it.</p>

<p>TeamProgramming++! Thanks ether++ and leont++!</p>

<h2>Zilla::Dist Support</h2>

<p>Once we got DZ supported, supporting ZD was trivial. The only difference is where the data goes. In this case it goes in the <code>Meta</code> file (where all the meta data does):</p>

<pre><code>=zild:
  inline:
    module: Acme::Math::XS
    inline: Acme::Math::XS::Inline
    ilsm: Inline::C
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, Zilla::Dist uses that info to generate the same <code>dist.ini</code> section above at <code>make release</code> time.</p>

<h2>Talking About My Generation</h2>

<p>It&#39;s a good time to pause, and realize that the whole of programming is pretty much just the <strong>generation</strong> of one thing from another. Programmers might not think about it that way all the time, but I(ngy) tend to <em>only</em> think about it that way.</p>

<p>When I get frustrated by the ways that I need to manage text to make the computer understand my idea, I often step back and think &quot;What is the world I want to be in right now? How would I rather be doing this?&quot;. If I come up with a killer answer that works wonderfully on almost all levels, I make it so.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what drives other folks to make new modules and languages and tools, but that&#39;s a big part of my MO. Inline is like that and Inline::Module is too. What is the minimal info I need to tell the Perl toolchain to Make It So?</p>

<p><code>&lt;/opinion&gt;</code></p>

<h2>The Acme Example Modules</h2>

<p>We&#39;ve rearranged the Acme::Math::XS git repo a bit. See this for details: <a href="https://github.com/ingydotnet/acme-math-xs-pm/blob/master/About.pod">https://github.com/ingydotnet/acme-math-xs-pm/blob/master/About.pod</a></p>

<p>We&#39;ve made Acme::Math::XS::XS become Acme::Math::XS (and deprecated the former). This is the pure (no Inline) version. It s on the <code>xs</code> branch of the repo. All the Inline::Module versions will be released to CPAN using the <code>Alt</code> names listed in the link above.</p>

<p>It is important to release this code as different modules, even though the code is exactly the same. We want to have proof that the modifications to the various build systems actually work in the wild.</p>

<h2>Next Week</h2>

<p>The next big step is definitely writing tests. Doing this type of work Test First would have caused too much churn early on. We needed to experiment and invent a non-trivial process that didn&#39;t exist. Now that we see it clearly, writing tests (and TDD) is the right choice.</p>

<p>We now have real, usable, open source software on GitHub, so the roadmap and problems will start being expressed as Issues: <a href="https://github.com/ingydotnet/inline-module-pm/issues">https://github.com/ingydotnet/inline-module-pm/issues</a></p>

<p>Finally, we need to convert some real XS modules like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ingy&#39;s <a href="YAML::XS">YAML::XS</a></li>
<li>David&#39;s <a href="Math::Prime::FastSieve">Math::Prime::FastSieve</a></li>
</ul>

<p>to use Inline::Module. This will happen first under the Alt namespace, then once they pass all tests same as the originals, we can make the real ones use Inline::Module.</p>

<p>I encourage interested people to do the same (but maybe wait until next week to start :).</p>

    November 9, 2014    by
    <a href="page/ingy-and-david-bio.html">Ingy and David</a>
  </p>
  <p>David and Ingy try to get the weekly report out by Saturday night each week, in order to make the Perl Weekly cut. Last week and this week, Saturday drifted into Sunday. Last week was due to unexpected visitors and this week Ingy was wiped out after his Pittsburgh Perl Workshop talk:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDRLIjojlhg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDRLIjojlhg</a></p>

<p>We had several great days of hacking this week. The goal was to get a fully working <code>Acme::Math::XS</code>, with these properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>Implemented with the new <code>Inline::Module</code></li>
<li>Plain old <code>Makefile.PL</code></li>
<li>Perl module with C code &quot;Inline&quot;</li>
<li><code>perl Makefile.PL &amp;&amp; make test</code> works author side</li>
<li><code>prove -lv t/</code> works (the same) author side</li>
<li><code>make dist</code> builds a dist that:
<ul>
<li>Includes Inline::Module build support code (in <code>inc/</code>)</li>
<li>Can build something to install user side, that:
<ul>
<li>Looks just like a normal XS install</li>
<li>Doesn&#39;t need to install Inline</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

<p>This is consistent with what we said we&#39;d do in last week&#39;s report. We got this 90% done, and released a new <code>Acme::Math::XS</code>.</p>

<p>The next steps are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Finish up <code>Inline::Module</code> good enough for a perfect <code>Acme::Math::XS</code></li>
<li>Write tests for the various concerns and expectations</li>
<li>Write up an Inline::Module tutorial</li>
<li>Port different kinds of existing XS modules to Inline::Module</li>
<li>Inline::Module support for common dist frameworks:
<ul>
<li>Dizt::Zilla</li>
<li>Module::Build</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Start filing bugs and nits as <a href="https://github.com/ingydotnet/inline-module-pm/issues">GitHub issues on Inline::Module</a></li>
</ul>

<p>After that, the grant goals will be mostly satisfied, and we will finish this one up!</p>

  <h2 class="blog-post-title">Inline Grant Weekly Report #2</h2>
  <p class="blog-post-meta">
    November 2, 2014    by
    <a href="page/ingy-and-david-bio.html">Ingy and David</a>
  </p>
  <p>This week was a little bit slower but we made progress. We released new versions of <code>Acme::Math::XS</code> and created/released <code>Acme::Math::XS::XS</code>. The two modules are the same except the former uses <code>Inline::Module</code> and the latter uses plain old XS. The idea is to get them both working identically so that there is something concrete to compare.</p>

<p>We did a bit of yak shaving early in the week. We wrote our own blog site software that we are growing up organically. We also patched and released <code>Swim.pm</code>, the markup formatter that all our writings are written in. We are trying to balance staying focused on finishing the grant on time, and also spawning as much cool stuff as we can along the way.</p>

<p>Speaking of cool, we do all our work in a shared dev environment called PairUp™. It works wonderfully, but we wanted others to be able to watch along too (televised pair programming). The way to do this is with termcasting which shows the tmux session in a webpage, so anyone can watch along. Combine this with IRC, and it gets awesome. Unfortunately our termcasting setup was failing us. Fortunately we found <code>doy++</code> on IRC, brought him into our pairup, had him fix things (he&#39;s the master of termcasting) and then we got it working. Come by #inline sometime and watch for yourself.</p>

<p>We further honed the Inline::Module dance. I&#39;ll try to explain it. When you create a module like <code>Foo::XS</code>, the <code>lib/Foo/XS.pm</code> module has a line like this:</p>

<pre><code>use Foo::XS::Inline C =&gt; &quot;…&quot;;
</code></pre>

<p>That means you need a <code>lib/Foo/XS/Inline.pm</code>, and you get that with:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; perl-inline-module create Foo::XS::Inline
</code></pre>

<p>The new, generated module looks (more or less) like this:</p>

<pre><code>package Foo::XS::Inline;
use base &#39;Inline&#39;;
use Inline::Module &#39;v1&#39; =&gt; &#39;0.02&#39;;
</code></pre>

<p>When you run tests, this module uses <code>Inline::C</code> to build the <code>C</code> under <code>blib/</code> like normal XS.</p>

<p>Now, here&#39;s the trick (and we haven&#39;t actually gotten it working yet)… when it&#39;s time build the dist we rearrange things:</p>

<ol>
<li>The version of <code>::Inline</code> above goes into the <code>inc/</code> directory</li>
<li>The <code>::Inline</code> under lib becomes a small Dynaloader invoking module
<ul>
<li>This is what gets installed user side</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>The Makefile system is tweaked to build the Inline code at <code>make</code> time</li>
</ol>

<p>We should get this working in the next couple days. Note that the whole point here is to make something that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Works as good or better than hand-XS</li>
<li>Is easy to distribute using any popular setup</li>
<li>Installs stuff identically to XS</li>
<li>Has <strong>no</strong> user dependencies (including no dep on anything Inline)</li>
</ul>

<p>In other news, David released <code>Inline::CPP</code> five times and got his cpantester&#39;s PASS rate up to an all-time high of 99.4%.</p>

  </p>
  <p>We (David and Ingy) had a productive week bootstrapping the <strong>Inline-for-XS-Modules</strong> project. Our primary optimization flags are:</p>

<pre><code>-Opublic
-Oagile
-Ocreative
-Ofun
</code></pre>

<p>Here are some highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>All work being done publicly:
<ul>
<li>David and Ingy code in remote <strong>PairUp™</strong> session (tmux)</li>
<li>All realtime communication in <strong>IRC</strong> (irc.perl.org#inline)</li>
<li>Tmux to be <strong>termcast</strong>ed soon (live terminal in a browser)</li>
<li>If you are interested, come join us!</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Figured out a decent <strong>Inline Module API</strong> strategy
<ul>
<li>Authors do 3 simple new things to ship Inline code to CPAN</li>
<li><strong>No end-user dependency</strong> on Inline for these modules</li>
<li>End result is essentially same as hand written XS</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Plans to support:
<ul>
<li>5-6 build systems: ie <code>Dist::Zilla</code>, <code>Module::Build</code>, etc</li>
<li>Many Inline languages (other than C/C++ <em>might</em> work)</li>
<li>Different extension module use cases: inline/external/libraries</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Created specification document: <a href="http://inline.ouistreet.com/node/v3e7.html">http://inline.ouistreet.com/node/v3e7.html</a></li>
<li>Released two new CPAN modules:
<ul>
<li><strong>Inline::Module</strong> (The majority of the grant coding)</li>
<li><strong>Acme::Math::XS</strong> (first test module using Inline::C)</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Created a <strong>new blog site</strong> to document the Inline Grant Project
<ul>
<li><a href="http://inline.ouistreet.com/">http://inline.ouistreet.com/</a></li>
<li>A new site using some of our other loved technologies: Cog, Coffee, make, Swim, Jemplate, gh-pages, BootStrap</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

<p>It is our hope to finish out most of the work in the next 2 weeks, and then work on bug reports after that. We plan to keep putting out blog posts/reports for at least a couple months after the grant is complete. We believe this work will make Extension Module Authoring a lot more accessible, and we want to keep the energy flowing.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a tiny example of how to make an Inline Extension Module. Take this one-liner:</p>

<pre><code>perl -E &#39;use Inline C=&gt;&quot;int add(int a, int b)&#123;return a+b;&#125;&quot;;say add(2,2)&#39;
</code></pre>

<p>Turn it into this module:</p>

<pre><code>package Acme::Math::XS;
our $VERSION = &#39;0.0.1&#39;;
use Acme::Math::XS::Inline C =&gt; &quot;int add(int a, int b) &#123;return a + b;&#125;&quot;;
</code></pre>

<p>Install Inline::Module:</p>

<pre><code>cpanm Inline::Module
</code></pre>

<p>Run this command line:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; perl-inline-module create Acme::Math::XS::Inline
</code></pre>

<p>Add this line to your <code>dist.ini</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[InlineModule]
</code></pre>

<p>Ship it:</p>

<pre><code>dzil release
</code></pre>

<p>One advantage we&#39;ve seen so far is that simple developer testing, just works:</p>

<pre><code>prove -l t/
</code></pre>

<p>There&#39;s no need to run <code>make</code> to build the C/C++/XS in <code>blib</code> and then add <code>-b</code> to the <code>prove</code> flags, because this is <strong>Inline</strong>!</p>

  <p>(or <strong>How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love The Perl</strong>)</p>

<p>Last week I returned from 3 weeks of adventure in Berlin and Netherland. Funny story… the night I arrived at Liz and Wendy&#39;s place, I was made aware of 2 things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Liz is on the TPF grant board</li>
<li>She had a surprise for me, but couldn&#39;t tell me until midnight :)</li>
</ul>

<p>Spoiler: <a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2014/09/grant-proposal-inlinecpp-modul.html">The Inline Grant</a> was approved!</p>

<p>The following evening, I attended the amsterdamx.pm (expats) at Booking.com++ HQ, and upon entering the meeting room, was asked by SawyerX if I could give a talk since ribasushi was stuck in traffic. Huh? WTF? Definitely! :) In the kind of coincidence that only happens regularly in the world of Perl, Karen Pauley happened to be there as well, not to mention Stevan, Jarrko and Dan Kogai! I rambled on about a dozen things that were currently loaded into ingy-RAM, but held off on talking about the grant as it hadn&#39;t been made public just yet.</p>

<p>7 days to the minute later I gave a talk at amsterdam.pm and the main subject was the Inline grant. Instead of a talk, I gave a &quot;listen&quot;! I asked everyone there how they would go about actually implementing the grant solution. I got a lot of ideas, and since then I think I&#39;ve figured it out. Stay tuned…</p>

<h2>Welcome to the Inline Grant blog!</h2>

<p>I think this is the first TPF grant to be given to a pair of pair programmers! David and I want to make things as open as we can, so we plan to give weekly updates in addition to the TPF monthly status updates.</p>

<p>Today (October 20th) marks the start of work in earnest on the grant. The delay is due to my unexpected but most fruitful trip to Europe. I&#39;m dejetlagged and ready to hack! David has also just finished a lovely family vacation (to Zion and Bryce National Parks (YAPC::15 attendees with wheels should take note!)).</p>

<p>We really want to thank the community for this opportunity to make Perl better!</p>
