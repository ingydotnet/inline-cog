= Description

*Cog* is a concept that Ingy d√∂t Net has been thinking on since 2006. It is a
granular-thought-data-store with many manifestations. In this context, it is
simply the blog and info data for the Inline grant project, that happens to
make a nice website.

= Details

This repo consists of several branches, each with a specific role:

- `master`      :: Top level container
- `bootstrap`   :: Bootstrap HTML layout and theming
- `build`       :: The tooling and templates to build a website
- `cog`         :: The /Cog/ data store
- `cogdb`       :: The tooling to manage the data store
- `gh-pages`    :: The end result!
